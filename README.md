# Wine Quality Prediction

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook (`wine_quality_prediction.ipynb`) provides a comprehensive analysis and prediction model for wine quality based on various features. The dataset used in this project includes information about different attributes of wines and their corresponding quality ratings.

- ## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is included in the repository (wine_dataset.csv). It contains the following columns:

fixed acidity
volatile acidity
citric acid
residual sugar
chlorides
free sulfur dioxide
total sulfur dioxide
density
pH
sulphates
alcohol
quality (target variable)
Usage

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the notebook:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- jupyter

You can install them using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter.

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Yourownvibhore/wine-quality-prediction.git
cd wine-quality-prediction
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook wine_quality_prediction.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook to explore the data, preprocess it, train a predictive model, and make predictions.

Results
The notebook includes visualizations, analysis, and the trained model's performance metrics. Feel free to customize and enhance the notebook as needed.
